        GDG DevFest Ukraine is brought to you with love, efforts and endless fun from GDG Lviv team. <br><br>

        So what is GDG exactly? Perhaps Google doesn't need an introduction. Google services became common nouns â€”
        every day we "google" things we need to know, check our Gmail on the go, and Google Maps is a lifesaver. For
        regular users, they are just handy services, but not for us. Developers see much more: APIs, scalability
        issues, complex technology stacks. And that is what GDG is about. <br><br>

        Ever wondered what does it take to make a big tech conference? Here it is: 14 people working all year round, 0
        full time workers and sometimes a lot of compromise :) If you're curious what's under the hood, we share a lot
        of tips, confessions and lessons learned on our team blog. <br><br>

        Also we are very talkative, so if you're a fellow community organizer or just have some random questions, feel
        free to reach any of us on social media. We'd love to help! <br><br>
